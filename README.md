# Face_Mask_Detection_Project
This Face Mask Detection Project is a computer vision project that detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not using CNN. This project involves developing a machine learning model that can accurately detect faces in real-time video or image feeds, and then determine if the face is covered with a mask or not.
